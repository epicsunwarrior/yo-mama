##Scope
To capitalize on the viral fury of the underground 'Yo Momma' battle scene, you have been tasked with designing and creating a webapp to help users find the best 'Yo Momma' joke to help them to become victorious.

##Project Description
Your Manager has laid out the following requirements for the project: 

* Implement a mock API to retreive the 'Yo Momma' jokes
* Allow users to interact with the application to get a new joke
* Implement the ability to convert the joke to a voice text

##Learning Objectives
By the end of this project the employee will be able to...

* Understand the difference between a GET and POST requests (HTTP Methods)
* Interpret the supplied API documentation and use the API for the application (APIs)
* Understand the role of the client and the role of the server (Client-Service Interaction)
* Understand how the client and the server interact (Client-Server Interaction)
* Analyze and interpret the supplied documentation to their project (Reading Comprehension)
* Ability to explain and discuss projects in terms of APIs and HTTP requests (Technical Vocabulary)

##Instructions
You are given ####### as the basis of the project, which must be cloned into your own workspace.  And take note of the comments in the provided scripts.

###1) API Creation

####Why do I need this:
As a developer, you will need to rely on components created by other people or other teams.  One way to interact with other components is through a systematic and rigid interface - known as the API (Application Programming Interface).  An API provides the specific rules of interaction between the callee and the caller - such as specifying the inputs required, the outputs expected, and possible error cases.  Some APIs return information about products and recommended products (Amazon), post updates to social networks (Twitter or Facebook), or send money to your friend (Paypal, Venmo, etc.).

####What am I going to do:

In this step, you will step into the role of an architect and create an API used by your website to get jokes from the service.  The API will need to specify the inputs and the output, as well as mocking the expecting output (pretending to be the server and returning an output).

###2) Adding Interactivity

####Why do I need this: 
A lot of websites provide interactivity to the users without requiring the page to reload, which creates a better experience for the user.

####What am I going to do: You will implement the ability to show a new joke to the user without the need of reloading the entire page

###3) Speech Implementation

####Why do I need this: 

This step provides an addition to the previous two steps.  We'll be adding another method of interaction to the application by adding the ability to convert text to speech.  And instead of building out the entire system to convert text to speech (there's not enough time in the entire school year for this...), we'll be interacting with Google's API to use their service to convert the text to speech.

####What am I going to do:

You will implement a method to use Google's API based on their documentation (with assistance from the web) to voice out the text.

##Vocabulary

* Application Program Interface (API) - A set of interfaces to interact another web-based resource.
* GET Requests - A request to retreive data from another resource
* POST Requests - A request to submit data to another resoure for processing
* AJAX Requests - A technique to provide interactivity between the client and server without reloading the page
